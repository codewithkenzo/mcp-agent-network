# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists
The MCP Agent Network aims to create a unified framework for agent communication and orchestration, enabling seamless interaction between different agent systems and services. By leveraging MCP technology, we can standardize how agents communicate while using Upsonic to handle complex workflows and task management.

## Problems It Solves
1. **Fragmented Agent Ecosystem**: Unifies disparate agent technologies under one communication protocol
2. **Complex Orchestration**: Simplifies managing multiple agents working on related tasks
3. **Limited Agent Communication**: Enables rich interactions between agents using standardized protocols
4. **Browser Automation Integration**: Seamlessly connects browser automation with agent workflows
5. **Agent Management Overhead**: Provides centralized management of agent tasks and states

## How It Should Work
1. Fast-agent.ai serves as the interface for human-to-agent communication
2. Upsonic handles orchestration, workflow management, and agent coordination
3. MCP connections to glama and smithery provide access to agent services
4. Browser automation tools enable agents to interact with web content
5. The entire system follows a modular approach, allowing easy extension and customization

## User Experience Goals
1. **Simplicity**: Easy to interact with multiple agents through a unified chat interface
2. **Power**: Access to complex, orchestrated workflows through simple commands
3. **Reliability**: Consistent behavior from agents across different tasks
4. **Extensibility**: Easy addition of new agent capabilities
5. **Transparency**: Clear visibility into what agents are doing and why
