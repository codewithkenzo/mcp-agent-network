# MCP Agent Network Project Brief

## Project Overview
An agent network built on top of MCP (Multi-agent Communication Protocol) technology, enabling intelligent agent communication, orchestration, and task execution through a unified interface.

## Core Requirements
1. Build on MCP technology as the foundation
2. Use Upsonic as the agent framework for orchestration
3. Implement browser automation with Playwright/browseruse and browser-tools-mcp
4. Utilize fast-agent.ai for MCP client and connection
5. Connect to MCP servers from glama and smithery
6. Create a modular, maintainable architecture

## Core Goals
1. Enable chat communication with all agents
2. Orchestrate workflows, LLM calls, memory, knowledge, and parallel tasks
3. Maximize Upsonic feature utilization
4. Maintain clean, focused codebase with proper testing
5. Keep features modular and maintainable

## Development Approach
1. Set up foundation and project structure
2. Establish MCP connections
3. Add features incrementally
4. Test thoroughly but clean up unnecessary test code
5. Stay focused on core features
