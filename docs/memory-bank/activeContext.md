# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
- Foundation setup completed
- Ready to implement MCP connection layer
- Building core components with actual functionality

## Recent Changes
- Created project directory structure
- Established memory bank documentation
- Defined system architecture and patterns
- Created basic Python package structure
- Implemented placeholder core classes
- Set up GitHub repository (https://github.com/codewithkenzo/mcp-agent-network)
- Created Python virtual environment with UV

## Next Steps
1. ✅ Set up Python environment with UV
2. ✅ Create project configuration files (pyproject.toml, etc.)
3. ✅ Set up GitHub repository
4. ✅ Implement core foundation classes (placeholders)
5. Implement MCP connection client with fast-agent.ai
   - Create MCP client class
   - Implement server connection functionality
   - Set up integration with glama and smithery
6. Add Upsonic integration
   - Create orchestration framework
   - Implement workflow management
   - Set up task coordination
7. Implement browser automation integration

## Active Decisions and Considerations
1. **Repository Structure**: Keeping a clean, minimal codebase with focus on essential functionality
2. **Dependency Management**: Using UV for Python environment management
3. **Testing Strategy**: Test-driven development for core features, cleaning up tests when stable
4. **Feature Prioritization**: Focus on core functionality first, then add extensions
5. **Documentation Approach**: Maintaining comprehensive memory bank for development continuity
6. **Implementation Approach**: Start with placeholder implementations, then add actual functionality
