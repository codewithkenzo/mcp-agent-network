# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
- Setting up the project foundation and structure
- Creating initial documentation
- Preparing the GitHub repository setup
- Planning core implementation strategy

## Recent Changes
- Created project directory structure
- Established memory bank documentation
- Defined system architecture and patterns
- Identified technical requirements and constraints

## Next Steps
1. Set up Python environment with UV
2. Create project configuration files (pyproject.toml, etc.)
3. Set up GitHub repository
4. Implement core foundation classes
5. Set up MCP connection client
6. Add Upsonic integration
7. Implement browser automation integration

## Active Decisions and Considerations
1. **Repository Structure**: Keeping a clean, minimal codebase with focus on essential functionality
2. **Dependency Management**: Using UV for Python environment management
3. **Testing Strategy**: Test-driven development for core features, cleaning up tests when stable
4. **Feature Prioritization**: Focus on core functionality first, then add extensions
5. **Documentation Approach**: Maintaining comprehensive memory bank for development continuity
