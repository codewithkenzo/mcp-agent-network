# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
- MCP connection layer implemented
- Ready to implement Upsonic orchestration layer
- Building with clear interface indicators and progress reporting

## Recent Changes
- Created project directory structure
- Established memory bank documentation
- Defined system architecture and patterns
- Created Python package structure
- Implemented MCP client and connection manager
- Added progress indicators (progress bars, spinners)
- Enhanced CLI interface with connection commands
- Set up GitHub repository (https://github.com/codewithkenzo/mcp-agent-network)
- Created Python virtual environment with UV

## Next Steps
1. ✅ Set up Python environment with UV
2. ✅ Create project configuration files (pyproject.toml, etc.)
3. ✅ Set up GitHub repository
4. ✅ Implement core foundation classes (placeholders)
5. ✅ Implement MCP connection client with status reporting
   - ✅ Create MCP client class
   - ✅ Implement connection manager
   - ✅ Add progress indicators
   - ✅ Add clear connection status reporting
6. Implement Upsonic integration
   - Create orchestration framework
   - Implement workflow management
   - Set up task coordination
7. Implement browser automation integration

## Active Decisions and Considerations
1. **Repository Structure**: Keeping a clean, minimal codebase with focus on essential functionality
2. **Dependency Management**: Using UV for Python environment management
3. **Testing Strategy**: Test-driven development for core features, cleaning up tests when stable
4. **Feature Prioritization**: Focus on core functionality first, then add extensions
5. **Documentation Approach**: Maintaining comprehensive memory bank for development continuity
6. **Implementation Approach**: Focus on clear interfaces with proper status reporting and feedback
7. **User Experience**: Use progress indicators for resource-intensive operations
8. **Code Quality**: Maintain high test coverage and regular commits to GitHub
