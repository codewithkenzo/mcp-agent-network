# Technical Context

## Technologies Used

### Core Technologies
- **MCP Technology**: Multi-agent Communication Protocol for standardized agent communication
- **Upsonic**: Agent framework for orchestration, workflows, memory, and knowledge management
- **Fast-agent.ai**: MCP client and connection interface
- **Playwright/browseruse**: Browser automation tools
- **Browser-tools-mcp**: MCP-compatible browser tools

### Infrastructure
- **MCP Servers**: Sourced from glama and smithery
- **Python**: Primary programming language
- **UV**: Python environment/package manager
- **GitHub**: Version control and project hosting

## Development Setup
1. Python environment managed by UV
2. Modular architecture with clear separation of concerns
3. Minimal script count, focused on essential functionality
4. Test-driven development approach for core features

## Technical Constraints
1. Compatibility with MCP standards and protocols
2. Integration with external MCP servers (glama, smithery)
3. Maintaining a clean, focused codebase
4. Ensuring proper error handling and resilience

## Dependencies
- Fast-agent.ai client
- Upsonic framework
- Playwright/browseruse for browser automation
- Browser-tools-mcp for MCP-compatible browser interaction
- Standard Python libraries for utilities and testing
