# Progress

## What Works
- Project directory structure established
- Memory bank documentation created
- Project architecture defined
- Basic Python package structure created
- Core AgentNetwork class created (placeholder implementations)
- CLI interface defined
- Tests created for basic functionality
- GitHub repository set up at https://github.com/codewithkenzo/mcp-agent-network
- Python virtual environment created with UV

## What's Left to Build
1. **Foundation Layer**
   - ✅ Basic project configuration
   - ✅ GitHub repository creation
   - ✅ Core modules and classes structure
   - Implement actual functionality in core classes
   
2. **MCP Connection Layer**
   - Fast-agent.ai client integration
   - MCP server connections (glama, smithery)
   - Protocol implementation
   
3. **Orchestration Layer**
   - Upsonic framework integration
   - Workflow management
   - Agent task coordination
   - Memory and knowledge management
   
4. **Browser Automation**
   - Playwright/browseruse integration
   - Browser-tools-mcp implementation
   - Web interaction capabilities
   
5. **User Interface**
   - Chat interface with agents
   - Command processing
   - Result visualization

## Current Status
- Foundation setup complete
- Ready to implement actual functionality
- Next steps: Implement MCP connection layer

## Known Issues
- None yet - basic structure working as expected
