# Progress

## What Works
- Project directory structure established
- Memory bank documentation created
- Project architecture defined
- Basic Python package structure created
- Core AgentNetwork class created with functional MCP connection implementation
- MCP connection layer implemented with client and connection manager
- Progress indicators (progress bars, spinners) for resource-intensive operations
- CLI interface enhanced with connection commands and status display
- Tests created and passing for all current functionality
- GitHub repository set up at https://github.com/codewithkenzo/mcp-agent-network
- Python virtual environment created with UV

## What's Left to Build
1. **Foundation Layer**
   - ✅ Basic project configuration
   - ✅ GitHub repository creation
   - ✅ Core modules and classes structure
   - ✅ MCP connection layer implementation
   - Implement actual server connections when MCP servers are available
   
2. **MCP Connection Layer**
   - ✅ Basic MCP client implementation with proper status reporting
   - ✅ MCP connection manager for multiple servers
   - ✅ Progress indicators for connection operations
   - Fast-agent.ai client integration
   - MCP server connections to glama and smithery (actual implementation)
   
3. **Orchestration Layer**
   - Upsonic framework integration
   - Workflow management
   - Agent task coordination
   - Memory and knowledge management
   
4. **Browser Automation**
   - Playwright/browseruse integration
   - Browser-tools-mcp implementation
   - Web interaction capabilities
   
5. **User Interface**
   - Chat interface with agents
   - Command processing
   - Result visualization

## Current Status
- Foundation setup complete
- MCP connection layer implemented with clear interface and progress indicators
- Ready to implement Upsonic orchestration layer
- All tests passing

## Known Issues
- None at present - all tests passing
