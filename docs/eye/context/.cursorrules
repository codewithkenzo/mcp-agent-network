# Cursor Rules for MCP Agent Network

## Project Patterns

### Code Structure
- Keep Python modules focused and minimal
- Use clear namespaces for different components
- Implement clean separation between layers
- Follow modular design principles

### Development Workflow
- Set up foundation first, then build on top
- Add MCP connection after foundation is ready
- Use test-driven development for core features
- Clean up test code after features are stable

### Dependencies
- Use UV for Python environment management
- Only add necessary dependencies
- Prefer standard library solutions when possible

### Implementation Focus
- Stay focused on core features
- Avoid unnecessary side quests
- Keep the architecture modular
- Ensure each component has a clear purpose

## Technology Stack Notes

### MCP Technology
- Fast-agent.ai is used for MCP client and connection
- MCP servers sourced from glama and smithery
- All agent communications follow MCP protocol standards

### Upsonic Framework
- Used for orchestration, workflows, memory, knowledge
- Handles parallel tasks and complex graphs
- Maximize feature utilization of Upsonic

### Browser Automation
- Playwright/browseruse for browser control
- Browser-tools-mcp for MCP compatibility

## Important Development Paths
- foundation → MCP connection → features
- Keep each layer complete before moving to the next
- Maintain thorough testing throughout

## General Guidelines
- Keep code clean and focused
- Document key decisions
- Update memory bank when architecture evolves
- Prioritize modular, maintainable architecture
